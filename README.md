This program is designed to duplicate rows by a certain value with its replacement when duplicating in a DBF file or in a group of files that you drag onto the executable file of the program. Simply drag one or more DBF files onto the executable file, then enter one or more pairs of the type col_name value1 value2 separated by a space.
Modified files will be saved in the 'changed' folder in the same place where the original files are located.
